How to write the FK of the recipe in ingredients
would normally write something like:

 const castIronSkilletFrittata = await Recipe.find({ name: 'Cast Iron Skillet Frittata' }) 

 then write: recipeId: castIronSkilletFrittata[0]_id

 I can't write the "const" for all new recipes


 2.
 character limit for some of the inputs


3.
If a field is empty (like gluten_free, or diet, or notes) then create a function that if empty don't display this text. 

4. should vegatarian, vegan, paleo being individual booleans?

5. capitalize words at the start of steps for instructions or ingredients

6. pluralizing ingredient if the quanity is more than one

7. for ingredients should there be a parameter for prepping (finely chopped, grated, thinly sliced, juiced)
